## Altimetry

### Transition Altitude 

Within the Papua New Guinea FIR, the transition altitude is 20,000 ft (`A200`)

### Transition Level

Within the Papua New Guinea FIR, the transition level is `F210`.


## Classes of Airspace
The airspace classification structure within the AYPM FIR differs from other VATPAC regions, most notably the use of Class F airspace for uncontrolled airspace. `PNG AIP ENR 1.4`

| Class | Flight Rules | Separation provided | Service Provided | Airspace Speed Limitation | Radio Communication Requirements | Subject to ATC Clearance |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **A** | IFR | All aircraft | ATC Service | N/A | Continuous two-way | **Yes** |
| | VFR not permitted | | |  |  | |
| **C** | IFR | IFR from IFR,<br>IFR from VFR,<br>IFR from SVFR | ATC Service | N/A | Continuous two-way | **Yes** |
| | VFR | VFR from IFR | ATC service for separation from IFR,<br>VFR/VFR Traffic Info (and traffic avoidance advice on request) | **250KT IAS** below **10,000FT AMSL** | Continuous two-way | **Yes** |
| **D** | | Not used within the AYPM FIR.
| **E** | | Not used within the AYPM FIR.
| **F** | IFR | Nil | FIS<br>IFR/IFR Traffic info,<br>IFR/VFR Traffic info |  **250KT IAS** below **10,000FT AMSL** | Continuous two-way | No |
| | VFR | Nil | FIS<br>VFR/VFR Traffic info on request | As Above | Continuous two-way | No |
| **G** | | Not used within the AYPM FIR

### Class F operations
Class F airspace is uncontrolled airspace. While aircraft operating in Class F airspace are not subject to ATC clearance, all aircraft (both IFR and VFR) are required to maintain continuous two-way communication.

This means that when departing from an uncontrolled aerodrome, both IFR and VFR aircraft are required to provide departure reports to ATC.

!!! phraseology
	* NTZ is a VFR aircraft which has departed from AYKV.*
    **NTZ**: "Moresby Control, NTZ with departure."  
    **AYPM**: "NTZ, Moresby Control."  
    **NTZ**: "Moresby Control, NTZ departed AYKV time 20, tracking 305 degrees, climbing to `A120` estimating AYEU time 58."  
    **AYPM**: "NTZ, area QNH 1010."
	
!!! tip
    Class F airspace is not common, and many pilots will be unfamiliar with the continuous two-way communication requirement for VFR aircraft. Wherever possible, be patient and help these pilots through the required position reports.
	
### Aerodrome Traffic Zones
Aerodrome Traffic Zones (ATZ) are established in within the Class F airspace around Goroka (AYGA), Madang (AYMD), Mount Hagen (AYMH), and Tokua (AYTK) aerodromes.

Within ATZs, ATC provides the following services:
	- runway separation service;
	- surface movement control;
	- aerodrome circuit traffic regulation (in VMC, by day);
	- traffic information; and
	- SAR alerting.
	
ATC clearances are required only for taxi, take-off and landing; clearance is not required to enter, leave or transit the ATZ.

Aircraft will make contact with ATC when advising of engine starts, prior to taxi for departure, and when entering the ATZ boundary.
