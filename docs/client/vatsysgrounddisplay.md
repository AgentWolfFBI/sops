VATPAC supplements vatSys with an enhanced ground display providing controllers with clearer, more informative surface radar tags and symbology.

### Departure Runway Display

The assigned departure runway now appears at the top of each aircraft's surface radar tag. This feature is especially helpful at multi-runway aerodromes (e.g., Sydney, Brisbane) and for identifying off-mode departures at other locations.

### Directional Arrow Symbols

All surface radar targets now use an arrow head symbol to indicate aircraft direction. The symbol's size reflects the aircraft's wake turbulence category, helping controllers visualise aircraft size and required separation between subsequent departures.

### Mode C & Standby Indication

| Symbol Type | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Filled arrow head** | Aircraft squawking Mode C |
| **Hollow arrow head** | Aircraft squawking Standby |

### Color Coding

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Blue** | Correlated departures |
| **Yellow** | Correlated arrivals |
| **Orange** | Uncorrelated tags |
